MATRIX

DELETED. Why? See https://github.com/rossmounce/cladistic-data/issues/3 
"I recommend removing/ignoring the matrix for Bates et al. 2005 (or somehow flagging it as bad data) on retiolitid 
graptolites. The printed cladistic matrix presented in the article (which you appear to have transcribed as printed) 
wasn't the one used for the presented analysis, and what is printed is a scrambled matrix that has no relationship to 
the printed character list. The scrambling apparently occurred somewhere in the publishing process."
